          <h3>Lakes and Rivers</h3>
          <p>We're going on a vacation! It's gonna be <strong>FREAKING GREAT!</strong>  Stay in our four star lakeside accommodation, whether you choose one of our log chalets or a contemporary apartment, you will look over stunning views of the valley. Perhaps go for a gentle stroll around the local village, a refreshing swim in the beautifully clear lake or a more energetic mountain walk or bike ride. You could also try out some of the exciting water sports on offer and after all of that you won’t be able to resist the delicious local cuisine at one of the traditional local eateries.</p>

          <h3>Beautiful Beaches</h3>
          <p>
            Our luxurious five star beach houses open their doors on to the expansive warm white sand that leads down to the stunning turquoise sea. There are restaurants, bars and cafes lining the sea front or if you can’t bear to leave the stunning view from your accommodation you can order from our gourmet menu, which will be delivered to you by our silver service staff. While you are here we also recommend you book one of our pamper sessions and take a dip in the mineral pool.

          <h3>Country Life</h3>
          <p>
            Our smallest and cutest resort is nestled into the rolling countryside on a working farm. The self-catering accommodation ranges from a cosy six bedroom farm house to quaint one bedroom apartments in the barn conversion. If you like the idea of getting stuck into farm life you can help collect the eggs in the morning and in return can take some for your own breakfast. You can also experience milking cows and feeding the animals. The onsite farm shop sells everything you need for the perfect cooked breakfast and the local town is home to a number of independent shops and a pub or two. You will also be perfectly situated to explore a number of the local walks.
